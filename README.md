## Project Title

Simple overview of use/purpose.

# Description

This project was developed to help the user in their quest for a better understanding of Javascript. Having a nifty, light-weight quiz makes the experience
This quiz allows the user to test their knowledge of Javascript which can be useful for both novice and advanced programmers. In order to use the application, you simply need to click the "start quiz" button which will present you with a Javascript-related question and a set of answers. Once you have made your choice text will appear indicating whether you have chosen correctly or incorrectly. By pressing the "start quiz" button you also set off a timer that counts down from 60 seconds.
Although I was unable to finish, practicingg using event listeners and arrays was beneficial to my understanding of Javascript. I made sure to use soft, complementary colors and rounded borders which makes for a more pleasant user experience.
